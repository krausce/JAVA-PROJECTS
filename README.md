# JAVA-PROJECTS

In this repo, I have compiled my academic work toward my software engineering degree thus far. This repo is not meant to
demonstrate completed professional grade projects but rather demonstrate my understanding of key software development/engineering
concepts. With that said, if you have a software idea in mind or just want to explore JAVA together, feel free to send me a message.

While some of these folders have intuitive naming schemes, others may not. That part is  a work in progress and will be updated as
necessary. If after looking through these examples, further explanation and/or demonstration is necessary, don't hesitate to reach
out.
