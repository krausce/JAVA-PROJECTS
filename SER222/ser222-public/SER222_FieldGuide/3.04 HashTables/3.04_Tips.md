####Give yourself between 10 and 20 hours for the homework
The homework for this section will require you to implement three different types of hash tables. Give yourself plenty of time to understand the implementations and what's being required. 

The hash table implemnentation you're going to create will have to handle generic types -.. Don't forget to utilize the `Entry` objects.

Don't forget to enable assertions in your IDE (for testing)! 

####Understand how deletions work with linear probing hash tables
Understanding how deletions work within a linear probing hash table will be helpful in future assignments, and during coding interviews. 

####Use the 3.04 Handout on hash tables
The handout for section 3.04 covers everything you need to know about hash tables. It explains the different types of hash tables, how to find a hash function, and gives several examples of hashing in action.
