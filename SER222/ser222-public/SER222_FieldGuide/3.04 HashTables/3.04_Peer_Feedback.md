#SER222 Field Guide
####Module 3.04 - Hash Tables
#####Peer Feedback


"This is one of the more difficult sections when it comes to the homework assignment. Understand that the implementations will be similar to what you've seen in class. However, there will be quite a few differences between how you implement the hash tables vs. how they're represented in the examples" - Wezley Sherman (Former SER222 Student and SER222 UGTA)

"Pay attention, this is 99% of your interviews" - Julia Schmidt (Former SER222 student)

"In my experience and based on the feedback from my fellow students who are also graduating this year, SER222 is the most important class in this program in terms of preparing for software development job interviews. Hash tables and Recusive algorithsm are fundamental topics that frequently come up in coding challenges during a technical interview. I recommend that you take the time to gain genuine understanding of these concepts as I am certain you will benefit from being proficient with them in your future" - Natallia Karaliova (Former SER222 student and SER222 UGTA)
