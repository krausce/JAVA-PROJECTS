#SER222 Field Guide
####Module 1.01 - Recursion
#####Peer Feedback

"The recursive maze assignment was both fun and very rewarding. Give yourself plenty of time to complete it." - Canyon Schubert (Former student)

"I had to utilize recursion in a coding interview. I was given a recursive program and was asked what it was doing. The material covered in 222 helped me understand the problem. - Ty Chase (Former student)

"Start on the recursion assignment early. Start by working with a single quadrant, and expand from there. Go to office hours if you get stuck. Teaching staff are very helpful!" - Wezley Sherman (Former student and 222 UGTA)

"Start the recursion assignment very early. This is the assignment you should go to office hours and get help early on with, because class time isn't enough to go over all of the materials covered in the assignment" - Rick Nguyen

"When you're working on the maze make sure exactly what and how many walls there should be doors in, and whether or not each wall should have a random number of doors for the entire square" - Tanner Lisonbee

"222 has been the basis of everything I'm doing at American Express. Understanding the basic data structures is critical when designing new classes and their implementation." - Bryan Perish (Former student and 222 UGTA)
